		NetBSD/i386 One Floppy NAT Box
		Release 0.8B :-)


I. What is this?

NetBSD/i386 one floppy bootable version. You can use it as a router or
a natbox on cheap IBM-PC box, for example, PC-110! 


II. Easy installation

You can use boot.fs.YYYYMMDD, which is bootable floppy.

Firstly insert floppy to your drive

# dd if=boot.fs.YYYYMMDD of=/dev/rfd0a bs=18k
# mount /dev/fd0a /mnt
# cd /mnt/conf/etc/

  Please edit the following files to fit your environment

	myname
	mygate
	ipf.conf
	ipnat.conf
	rc.conf

  and make your network interface files, for example,

	ifconfig.ne0
	ifconfig.ep0

# sync
# umount /mnt


2. boot!


III. How to make it by yourself

1. extract this package, for example, "floppy_natbox-19991126.tar.gz".

2. move it to under /usr/src/distrib/i386/floppies/floppy_natbox
   (here we assume it as "/usr/src/distrib/i386/floppies/floppy_natbox").

	% tar zxvf floppy_natbox-19991126.tar.gz
	% mv floppy_natbox-19991126 /usr/src/distrib/i386/floppies/floppy_natbox

3. cd /usr/src/distrib/i386/floppies/floppy_natbox

4. check configuration file

   conf/

	conf/ROUTER	(kernel configuration file)
	conf/mk.conf	${ARCH} (default "i386")

   conf/etc/		router configuration
			(corresponding to a subset of usual etc/).

	conf/etc/ipf.conf
	conf/etc/ipnat.conf
	conf/etc/ifconfig.$YOUR_ETHER_INTERFACE (e.g. ifconfig.ne0, ifconfig.ep0)
	conf/etc/rc.conf

5. make

6. insert the floppy to your machine Floppy Drive.

7. ./INSTALL.sh. 

   Congraturations! You've got NetBSD NAT Box boot floppy! 

8. reboot by the boot floppy


IV. TODO

We should compile it under other than /usr/src ;-).
